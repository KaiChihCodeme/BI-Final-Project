## Introduction

The object of this project is to analyze the value of business data and provide consultation and suggestions based on the result of the analysis.

We selected the "2017 Google Playstore" as our dataset from Kaggle. It's a dataset contain with the apps related attributes, we'd like to analyze the relation of the features within this dataset.
e.g., the amount of installation is a convincible way to prove this app is popular and have lots of business benefit. we were curious to know which features lead to high installation.

So, we used "Linear Regression", "Decision Tree" and "SVM" to analyze this dataset and came up with some thoughts and suggestions.

This project is written in Python.  Chose Jupyter Notebook to implement our experiment as well.

Used Scikit-learn, NumPy, and pandas to complete this work.
